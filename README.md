# Arcade-Game
Arcade game is a frogger like game, developed by Anna Monacelli for Udacity course.
The goal of the game is to score the maximum points before getting rid of all lifes.
Done using my 5yo daugther (Sofia) guideline.

### How to run:
In order to run the game, open the file index.html contained in the root folder with JS enabled browser.

### Instructions:
  - use the arrows key to move the character from the bottom line to the upper line (water)
  - Avoid bugs that are running on the stoned path.
